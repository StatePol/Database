    "text": "What is this tutorial?\nThis is a 1-hour tutorial that can be used to teach or as self-paced learning.\nWe introduce Quarto by exploring this tutorial website, and practicing the basic Quarto workflow using different tools (GitHub browser, RStudio, and Jupyter) for editing your website.\nWe’ll start off from the browser so you don’t need to install any additional software, however this approach is very limited and you will soon outgrow its capabilities. If you don’t already have a workflow to edit files and sync to GitHub from your computer, I recommend RStudio. You don’t need to know R to use RStudio, and it has powerful editor features that make for happy workflows.\nQuarto.org is the go-to place for full documentation and more tutorials!"

We help researchers reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research teams as part of the broader global open movement.\nWe’re developing this tutorial to help folks with different levels of technical skills use Quarto for documentation and tutorial building. This tutorial was originally created for several different audiences: NASA-Openscapes researcher support engineers using Python, communications directors at organizations promoting open science who do not identify as coders, and fisheries scientists curious about transitioning from RMarkdown. We’re hoping it’s useful to folks with backgrounds as wide as these; if you find it useful or have suggestions for improvement, please let us know by clicking “Edit this page” or “Report an issue” at the upper right side of any page."
